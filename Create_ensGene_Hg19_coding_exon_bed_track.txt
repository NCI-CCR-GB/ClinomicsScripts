# download ensGene Hg19 coding exon bed track from: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
# created merged track by Galaxy
# coverted to gff format using Galaxy
# removed non-regular chromsomes using the following command

   grep -v "^chr[Un0-9XY]*_" enGene.cds.hg19.bed > enGene.cleaned.cds.hg19.bed

# sort the bed tracks using betools sort 

   bedtools sort -chrThenSizeA -i enGene.cleaned.cds.hg19.bed > enGene.cleaned.sorted.cds.hg19.bed
